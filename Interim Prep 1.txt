what is spring framework
-------------------------

Spring is a powerful open-source, loosely coupled, lightweight, java framework meant for reducing the complexity of developing enterprise-level applications.
This framework is also called the “framework of frameworks” as spring provides support to various other important frameworks like JSF, Hibernate, Structs,
EJB, etc


what is spring boot
-------------------

Spring Boot is an open-source, java-based framework that provides support for Rapid Application Development and gives a platform for developing stand-alone and production-ready spring applications with a need for very few configurations.



spring boot standalone project
------------------------------

Spring Boot helps developers create applications that just run. Specifically, you can create stand-alone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server.
You can create stand-alone applications by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process. As a result, you can start your application on any platform by pressing the Run command. (You can opt out of this feature to build applications without an embedded web server.)



what is meant by singleton class?

In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a special type of class that allows only one instance (or object) of itself to be created. Imagine it like a unique key that opens a special door. No matter how many times you try to create a new object from a singleton class, you’ll always get the same instance that was created initially12.

Here are the key points about singleton classes:

Single Instance: A singleton class ensures that only one instance of itself exists throughout the entire lifetime of a program.
Global Access: It provides a global point of access to that single instance.
Private Constructor: The constructor of a singleton class is made private, preventing other instances from being created.
Static Method: A public static method is used to retrieve the single instance of the class.



what is ment by rapid application development
---------------------------------------------
Rapid Development: By automating configuration and providing starter dependencies, Spring Boot accelerates the development process, allowing developers to focus on delivering business value rather than dealing with infrastructure concerns.


Autoconfiguration
-----------------

Autoconfiguration initializes applications with pre-set dependencies so that you don't have to configure manually. Java Spring Boot comes with built-in autoconfiguration capabilities, which automatically configure both the underlying Spring Framework and third-party packages based on your settings. This approach, based on best practices, helps avoid errors.

Even though you can override these defaults after the initialization is complete, the initial setup accelerates development. Java Spring Boot's autoconfiguration feature enables you to start developing your Spring-based applications fast and reduces the possibility of human errors.


Explain the advantages of using Spring Boot for application development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! **Spring Boot** is a powerful framework that simplifies Java application development. Here are some key advantages of using Spring Boot:

1. **Quick and Safe Environment Configuration**:
   - Spring Boot provides an out-of-the-box configuration, allowing developers to start building applications right away without spending time on complex 	setup¹.
   - It eliminates the need for manual configuration, making the development process faster and more efficient.

2. **Reduced Code Length and Simplified Development**:
   - Spring Boot leverages annotations for straightforward code understanding.
   - Boilerplate configurations are automatically generated, reducing repetitive code for common functionalities¹.

3. **Efficient Testing**:
   - Spring Boot offers a default setup for unit and integration tests.
   - Developers can focus on delivering business value rather than dealing with infrastructure concerns⁴.

4. **Autoconfiguration**:
   - All components needed for a production-grade Spring application are automatically configured.
   - This accelerates development and ensures a robust environment².

5. **Prebuilt Embedded Servers**:
   - Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow.
   - These servers simplify app deployment and enhance productivity².

what is Normalization

Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table. Normalization also helps to organize the data in the 
database. It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.

Normalization organizes the columns and tables of a database to ensure that database integrity constraints properly execute their dependencies. 
It is a systematic technique of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy (repetition) and undesirable characteristics like 
Insertion, Update, and Deletion anomalies.
